# Gutenberg blocks plugin README

## CA.gov Design System Gutenberg Blocks

Version 1.2.0

`cagov-design-system-gutenberg-blocks`

Integrates the [State of California Design System](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov) into the WordPress Gutenberg editor.

The [CA.gov](http://CA.gov) design system defines structured markup with CSS and custom elements.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is the open-source editor that is included in core WordPress, version 5.0 and later. It allows content editors to use pre-defined markup blocks in content.

## How to use this plugin

- Install and enable this plugin
- This will make a block library available in the editor UI. More guidance for content editors can be found here.
    - Please also check the content principles of the design system for more information on improving content for State of California website users.
- Keep the plugin up-to-date for important security and design updates.
- Check our CHANGELOG for notifications of major updates for database updates to keep content in sync with design system changes.

## Maintenance

- Since the Design System is in continuous development, there are periodic updates available.
- Check the maintenance docs on how to perform an update.

## Dependencies

## Contributions

Please submit a pull request to this repository and the design system team will review it.

This plugin is the official and tested set of block plugins for the core design system.

This plugin is still in beta while the newly established design system is adopted. 

We are discussing a working-group and governance team to assist with guidance and coordination on the future of this feature. 

## Custom Gutenberg blocks

If you would like to add additional Gutenberg blocks to your project, you can do this similarly to how we have implemented it for the Department of Cannabis Control website.
